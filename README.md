Data Overview
The dataset used in this analysis is the House Prices dataset, which includes various features related to residential properties. The goal is to predict the sale prices of these properties based on the given features.

Analysis Steps
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding the dataset, visualizing distributions, and identifying patterns in the data.

Preprocessing: Handling missing values, removing redundant features, addressing outliers, and transforming the target variable for better model performance.

Feature Engineering: Creating new features to enhance the predictive capabilities of the models.

Modeling: Implementing two regression models - Linear Regression and XGBoost - and evaluating their performance.

Key Findings
Important Features: Identified key features influencing house prices, such as total square footage and overall property quality.

Model Comparison: Explored the performance of Linear Regression and XGBoost, considering factors beyond RMSE.

Feature Importance Discrepancies: Observed differences in feature importance between the two models.
